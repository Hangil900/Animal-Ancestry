     * Return the list of genes that are in the DNA string previously by setDNA().
     * <pre>
     * Rules for parsing the DNA string to find the genes are as follows:
     * 
     * 1. Parse from left to right.
     * 2. In the DNA sequence, a gene is delimited by the start sequence CAG
     *    and end sequence TGC. Therefore, when the start sequence CAG is
     *    encountered, begin a gene, and the next occurrence of the end
     *    sequence TGC terminates the gene.
     * 3. Inside a gene, CAG does not start another gene.
     * 4. The start and end sequences are NOT part of the gene; they
     *       just delimit it.
     * 5. A gene may be empty. If an empty gene is encountered, ignore it --do not add it to the list
     * 6. If there is a start of a gene (CAG) but no following end delimiter (TGC),
     *    the substring beginning at the start is NOT considered to be a gene and
     *    is discarded. In this case, there are no more genes to extract.
     * 7. The DNA string may contain duplicate genes. Function parse
     *    does not remove duplicates from the list it constructs.
     * </pre>
     * @return A list of genes found in the DNA string, in the order in 
     *         which they appear.
