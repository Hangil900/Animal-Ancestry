Animal-Ancestry

Collaborated with Chris Jung. A4GUI file was implemented with the help of our professor, Ken Birman.

To Run: Simply clicking run, will run the program and display a gui. Clicking on an animal will show the animals with closest ancestry.

The objective of the program is to calculate and determine how closely related different animals are. This was determined by parsing through the "DNA" of the animals, and comparing each animal to the other animals. Using a point system which adds or deducts points for certain patterns of DNA, we were able to calculate the similar ancestry of the animals. The display which runs was implemented such that, when the user clicks on an animal, the most related to the least related animals are highlighted in shades of red to black respectively.
